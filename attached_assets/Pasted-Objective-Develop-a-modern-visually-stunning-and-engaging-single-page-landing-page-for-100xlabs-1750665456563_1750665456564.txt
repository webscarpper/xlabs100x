Objective:
Develop a modern, visually stunning, and engaging single-page landing page for "100xlabs," a Web3 marketing agency. The page should effectively showcase the agency's services, highlight client successes, and establish a strong brand presence.
I. Branding & Overall Style:
Agency Name: 100xlabs
Logo:
Use the stylized "X" from the provided image file: 100xLabs LOGO full res.png.
This logo should be prominently placed, likely in the navigation bar and potentially in the footer.
Visual Style: Modern, clean, professional, with a Web3/crypto aesthetic. Animations should be smooth and impactful. Ensure the page is responsive and looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
II. Hero Section:
Primary Visual:
Feature the image WhatsApp Image 2025-06-23 at 09.52.05_39ead9f8.jpg (the glowing green X on a black background) as the central element or background of the hero section.
Animation:
Incorporate an dynamic animation involving financial candlestick charts.
This animation should depict candlesticks (both red and green) forming or moving across the section, perhaps starting small and growing.
The animation must culminate dramatically with the appearance of a very large green "god candle," signifying massive growth or success. This could be integrated with or appear behind/around the primary glowing X visual.
The overall effect should be eye-catching and reinforce the "100x" concept.
Headline/Tagline: Include a compelling headline that captures the essence of 100xlabs (e.g., "Amplifying Web3 Projects by 100x," "Your Catalyst for Crypto Growth," or similar – you can suggest options or let Replit's AI propose some based on the services).

V. Footer:
Include basic footer information: Copyright 100xlabs (Year), and potentially links to social media if available (not specified, but common), or a simple contact email/method.
VI. Technical Considerations for Replit AI (if applicable):
Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the structure, styling, and animations.
Consider modern front-end technologies like React, Vue, or Next.js if they facilitate a better outcome for animations and structure, especially since "React, Tailwind, Next.js" are mentioned in your services.
Ensure the landing page is fully responsive across all major devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
Optimize for fast loading times and smooth animations.
Prioritize clean, well-commented code.
